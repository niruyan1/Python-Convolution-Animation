About the Map
For the United States, by default we mostly only have NEXRAD and Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) sites displayed on the map. You can also choose to view radar sites from U.S. television stations by selecting that option in the options panel on the map.

Click a radar site on the map for more information, including a link to imagery if available.

When you choose to show the range of the imagery on the map, green circles indicate radars for which radar data is publicly available. Eventually, we may use red circles to indicate radars that do not currently have data available to the public in real-time, but either have in the past (and the radar could still be operating), could eventually be available in real-time, or at times have had imagery occasionally released (such as through social media). If we eventually add more options to the map we may add red circles again, which we were using initially, to give people the ability to hide them.

When you export radar sites from the map, only the radar sites you have chosen to display will be exported.

You can export an HTML file from our map that contains a complete listing of the radar sites in our database. You can also view the list in your browser here.
About the Database
The ranges in our database indicate the maximum range of publicly available data, either currently available or in the past. Because of obstacles, such as mountains, the range noted for many radars does not indicate the actual coverage of the radar. Additionally, while some radars have long ranges, due to the curvature of the Earth the radar will not be able to see lower levels of the atmosphere at these extended ranges.

Some radar sites have no range noted, but may be included for other reasons.

Our database will never have a complete listing of all radar sites. It is intended to be mostly about radar sites that currently have radar data available publicly.

Some of the radar locations in the sources we used were estimated. We verified the location of each radar in our database using satellite imagery. The coordinates we use are not official. We used coordinates we selected based on the location of the radar in either Google Earth or another similar source we used for satellite imagery.

For links to most of the world's meteorological services, including for countries that we couldn't find radar data for, view the list of National Services for WMO Members.

If you would like to view some of the supporting information for this project, released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License, view the unminifed JavaScript file here for more information about some of the radar sites. If you want to use our interactive map on your own website, please download the map page (including all scripts and the CSS file) and upload it to your own site. You can download and use the script however you like for free, with or without attribution to us. (ArcGIS attributions on the map are required)
How We Find Radar Locations
We use a lot of different methods to try to find weather radars. We have spent thousands of hours looking for weather radars.

It should be noted that this will never be anything close to a complete list. We mostly want to have a list of radars in which data is publicly available. There are many organizations that have weather radars and we can't possibly know of all of them. It wouldn't be too helpful to know of a private company that has a weather radar, but never releases that data publicly. While most U.S. television stations don't have radar data available online from their own radars, we include them because they may include this data on-air.

We use Google to search for various websites, documents and images to help us locate weather radars. Who owns a radar? Who built the radar? Construction company? Who operates the radar? We search for records on bidding, contracts and permits. In some cases we even search land ownership records, though some radars are put on land that is leased.

If we know a radar is near a location, we might search for pictures and videos of the location, such as a city skyline, or the top of a mountain, rather than just a radar itself, and try to find the radar. Then we have a better idea of where to look in satellite imagery.

We use various search engines. We mostly use Google, but also use Microsoft Bing sometimes too. We will also use a search engine that is popular for the region we are searching, such as Baidu (China) and Yandex (Russia). We'll also search Google News.

We might try to look for a weather station, or meteorological bureau, in the hope that the radar is at the location or is listed with that name. We might zoom in to a city in Google Earth and then search for weather office or station, or with a word from the local language, to get results in that particular city. (or the national weather service name, or abbreviation, for the country)

It's sometimes tricky to determine which are weather radars and which are surveillance radars at airports.

Imagery Sources:
Google Earth
This is the main source for imagery we use. We use the "Historical Imagery" feature in this program to view recent and historical satellite imagery. We use the "Terrain" feature to help determine what are the highest spots in an area in which we expect a radar to be. We can use the "Photos" layer to help view photos in various spots, such as on mountains trying to view what is there or of a city skyline.

Google Maps
We sometimes right click the map and select the "What's here?" option to get more information. In addition to mapping, we use Google Street View imagery. You can also view historical imagery, if available, once you are viewing Google Street View imagery. (to see if a radar used to exist in a place it doesn't now) Click the top left corner when clicking "Street View" and the date. We also use Google Street View in Google Earth. We might view imagery from a high bridge or a high roadway junction to see if we can spot a radar.

Bing Maps
On rare occasions, Microsoft's Bing Maps might have more recent imagery. We most often use Bing for their bird's eye imagery feature. To access it, when available, right click on the map and click "View bird's eye". You can rotate the view in 90 degree increments. They also have a feature like Google. You can click the "Streetside" option when available.

Google Images
This helps us find pictures of a radar, radar imagery and/or perhaps diagrams of some kind. This can help lead us to a location of a radar.

Sentinel Hub EO Browser
While the imagery is very low resolution, using their compare feature to view imagery at a time when the radar was not yet built, compared to when we know it has, helps to narrow down where a radar is if we don't have recent high resolution imagery available. We need to know where to look and this is most helpful if the area is rather remote.

Wikimapia
While this can be used to find some radars, it is easiest to find pictures of a radar using this site by navigating to it once you have found it. Then you can verify what it looks like. This site might be searched easiest using Google.

Twitter
Searching for photos, videos and/or tweets can help find information on a radar. If you know the organization that manages the radar, find their Twitter account and search for their username and the radar location, or just the word "radar".

YouTube
We use this option mostly for airport landings and takeoffs. If we know of a radar around an airport, this can help us find it. Then we know where to look on satellite.
Data Sources & Other Tools Used:
WMO Radar Database
This is the main source we use. We verify a radar site's location manually by searching satellite imagery at the coordinates listed before adding it to our map. Their database is maintained by Turkey's meteorological service on behalf of WMO members.

RainViewer
While many of the radar locations in this site come from the WMO Radar Database, there are many other radar sites as well. Unlike most of the radar sites in the WMO Radar Database, this site also has links to radar imagery.

EUMETNET's OPERA Database
This database is for radars in Europe. You can learn more about it here. (Operational Programme for the Exchange of Weather Radar Information from the European Meteorological Services Network)

Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
Many U.S. television radars were found using the FCC's advanced search. We usually select "RS - Land Mobile Radiolocation" for "Match only the following radio service(s)". As a name, we would enter various TV station ownership groups, like Nexstar for example.

WMO Integrated Global Observing System
You can view a map here of "surface-based observing stations and platforms". In case a radar site also has a meteorological station that is listed here, this can also be helpful. They also have some radars as well.

Weather Underground's Wundermap
You can view weather stations from around the world on their map. If looking for a radar, and we kind of know where to look, it can be helpful sometimes to look to see if a weather station might be near a radar.

Meteorological Service Websites for WMO Members
This page links to most of the world's meteorological services.

Translation: Google Translate | Bing Microsoft Translator
It's important to be able to search in local languages for radars. We can use the name of the city a radar is in, and other words translated to the local language, to be able to search various search engines. (translated words like: radar, Doppler, weather, station, coordinates, latitude and longitude)

United Nations Statistics Division
Countries on this page are mostly organized by region according to how the United Nations defines geographic regions. (click the "Geographic Regions" tab on that page) This groups some countries that many consider to be in Europe into western Asia instead.
Map Troubleshooting
If the "3D" option on our map doesn't work, you may need to enable hardware acceleration or unblock your graphics card. Click here to learn more about how to adjust your browser's settings.
Database Updates
Due to the massive number of radar sites in our database, we don't routinely check all the radar sites. If you know of a radar site that is not on our map, or find a link that no longer works, please contact us.

There are a lot of radar sites from TV stations in the United States. While we have added some of them, there are likely many that we have missed. If you know of some we missed, let us know. For other countries, we mostly only include radar sites from government agencies, though we would be interested in adding others as well, especially if there is less coverage for that area available.
To link to our map online, you can choose the basemap, center and zoom on startup like this:

http://tropicalglobe.com/radar_database/?basemap=gray-vector&zoom=4&center=20,-80

You can choose from the following basemaps:

"satellite", "hybrid", "streets-navigation-vector", "streets-night-vector", "streets-vector", "streets-relief-vector", "osm", "topo-vector", "gray-vector", "dark-gray-vector", "terrain" and "oceans"

We may remove it, but you can also use "light_gray_no_labels" or "dark_gray_no_labels" as basemaps for now as well.

Durrës (Bisht Palle), Albania
The imagery from this radar was available here in the past. The date of the last available imagery is from 2016. (as of October 2019) It's uncertain if this radar is still operational.

The location of this radar may not be accurate. Based on satellite imagery, photographs of the radar, and using radar imagery, it is likely that these coordinates are close to the actual coordinates of the radar. A picture of the small radar, as well as of the tower it is on, can be found in the PDF document here. Based on that document, it is a MicroStep-MIS MMR-50 X-band radar. That document says that the installation of the radar was completed in March 2015. It also says that the tower was new. Using historical satellite imagery in Google Earth, it seems like this is the tower that is most likely the one the radar is on. Because current imagery from the radar couldn't be found online, the range is not noted on the map.

You can learn more about ADRIARadNet, the project this radar was a part of, on the site here. It's possible that an application on the site here might have data, but it requires a password. (when we tested this site in October 2022 it didn't load)

Information here says this radar was a prototype that was built before they expanded their radar network. A photograph of this radar site shows the word "prototipo" (prototype) written on the side of the tower. As of updating this page for this country, data did not seem to be available online. There is a smaller dome located right next to the larger radar tower at this site. Other radars of this type in the country have a range of 240km for publicly available imagery. No range is shown on the map since public imagery doesn't seem to be available.

Neuquén, Argentina
Argentina is expanding its radar network. Most of the radars in the National Weather Radar System (Sistema Nacional de Radares Meteorológicos, SiNaRaMe) are owned by the Secretariat of Infrastructure and Water Policy (Secretaría de Infraestructura y Política Hídrica), part of the Ministry of Public Works (Ministerio de Obras Públicas). They were installed by INVAP. You can learn more about their radar network here. In 2023 and 2024, they will be adding ten new radars that will also be installed by INVAP. You can learn more here (with a map of where the sites will be located), here and here. The new radars will be located in the following locations:

San Martín (Mendoza province), Argentina
Like in the Jujuy province, the radars in the Mendoza province are for help with monitoring and combating hail. These radars do not operate all the time. They may operate during hail season or just for storms. The range of these radars is uncertain. The imagery available is rectangular. There may also be two mobile radars as well. This makes it difficult to determine the range of imagery. The San Martin and San Rafael radars might be S-band and have a shorter range. The Tunuyán radar might be C-band and have a longer range. That is based on this page and this one which shows GIF images that indicate that the Tunuyán radar might have a longer range. The range shown in those images differ between the images available.Additionally, the positioning of those GIF Images don't match up too well for some of the radars. It's unclear if all three of the radar sites shown on our map are still operational. Additionally, some of the imagery shown might be from mobile radars. This 2017 document also has some information about these radars. That document talks about these radars being Russian MRL-5 S-Band radars. Therefore, it's confusing as to what band the Tunuyán radar is or if there is another newer radar.

Because imagery is not always available, and the range is uncertain, the range for these radars are not shown on the map.

San Salvador de Jujuy, Argentina
As of last checking in August 2023, it didn't appear that radar data was publicly available. Based on satellite imagery, and the WMO Radar Database, this radar was built in 2017. Information here (PDF) indicates that this is the second radar in the region. It's unclear where the first one, which may have been installed in 1997, is. That first one is a Russian MRL-5 S-Band radar and might be mobile. The radars in the Jujuy province, like the ones in the Mendoza province, are for help with monitoring and combating hail. These radars do not operate all the time. They may operate during hail season or just for storms.

The agency listed as being responsible in that PDF file is Latser S.A. and the WMO Radar Database lists Latitud Sur S.A. as the owner.

We haven't been able to find radar imagery from Armenia online. We also don't know if these MRL-5 radars are still operational. A PDF file here from September 2018 from World Bank says: "Armenia has three (outdated) meteorological radars that provide images to the AHS: one for aviation and two for hail suppression."

We don't know what their official website is. The WMO links to a site that no longer exists (http://www.meteo.am/) on their page that lists National Services" for WMO members. That older site was for the "Ministry of Emergency Situations". We link to their current site, a web address that was also included on the old site that no longer exists. We also don't know the current name of their meteorological service. You can view a page here that says in 2002 that an older organization was reorganized into two organizations, one of them being the "State hydrometeorological and monitoring service". The WMO also uses that name.

Using the coordinates for this radar site from the HTML of the page that data is on, we then looked up low resolution satellite imagery using the Sentinel Hub EO Browser and found a bright spot near where the new radar was supposed to be built. Based upon an artist impression of the radar here, the radar was to be located next to Aerodrome Road. The coordinates we selected were about 250 meters from the coordinates of the Bureau of Meteorology and appears to be where the radar is likely located.

The coordinates for this radar site are estimated. On satellite imagery, as of imagery from September 2021, you could see construction of the radar starting at the coordinates given by their website. (32.744S 148.708E) We chose a location about 50 meters away, about where it looks like the radar will likely be built. The coordinates we chose are likely less than 20 meters from the actual location of the radar.

"This installation is primarily a windfinding radar. The coverage in weather watch mode is poor. Surrounded by mountains and hills in most directions, it provides coverage for the immediate area surrounding Hobart Airport, about 40km along the Coal River Valley to the northwest and to the southeast over Frederick Henry Bay to the Tasman Peninsula." Quote from the page here.

"The Bureau's radar network is comprised of two types of radar - Dedicated 24 hour weather watch radars and part-time windfinding radars. Part-time windfinding radars are used by the Bureau to track weather balloons to measure the wind conditions of the upper atmosphere. Upper atmosphere wind conditions are a vital piece of information to assist forecasters in preparing accurate forecasts." Quote from the page here.

"Part-time Windfinding Radars have routine periods when weather watch coverage is not available. This normally occurs, up to 4 times a day, for approximately 1.5 hours as shown in the table [at the link here]. During these periods these radars will be engaged in tracking of high-level balloons for the measurement of winds in the upper atmosphere."

The location of this radar is uncertain. The WMO coordinates (41.0833N 45.5E) are about 2.5km northwest of the coordinates we chose. There looks to be one or two radars here. If there are two, one might not be a weather radar. Because the WMO coordinates are somewhat estimated, as that is 41°5'0"N 45°30'0"E in degrees minutes and seconds, which means it's rounded, our coordinates might be close to correct. There are two objects here. Based on a picture from Baron Weather of what we think is the Goygol site, this could be a very small radar. We actually chose an object that is 25 meters from the object that looks more like a radar because that other object looks like the picture of what we think is the other MRL-5 radar.

Azerbaijan does not seem to provide radar data in real time. However, they do describe what they see on the radar, sometimes throughout the day. We link to that page for each of the two new Baron radars they have. They also occasionally link to their YouTube channel which has animation of the radar sometimes. Based on a Facebook post here and some news articles, the range of the radar is 250km. Because the clips online can vary in what they show, we don't know what range is available to the public, when it is made available. Because they often describe, and sometimes show radar data, we do show the range on our map for the two Baron radars. A brief info page on their radars is here on their site. Some pictures of the radars are here.

A page here from Baron Weather, from April 5th, 2021, says that Azerbaijan installed two new Baron radars. It says "Leaders in the county of Azerbaijan are celebrating the installation of two Baron C-band doppler radars that will help modernize the nation's hydrometeorological network. The radars have been strategically placed to provide high-quality data, one in the Goygol region the other in the Shamakhi region. The dual-polarization radars will provide a much more accurate and in-depth picture of precipitation in the atmosphere compared to the MRL-5 radars the nation had been using for more than 40 years." From a picture on that page, we can see that the Goygol radar is located next to what looks to be an older MRL-5 radar that was not in the WMO Radar Database. We include one MRL-5 radar that is in the WMO Radar Database and the two newer radars on our map. We do not know if any MRL-5 radars are still used.

A PDF file here (PDF page 226) from 2021 indicates that three more doppler radars may be planned to bring the total to 5. They don't seem to count the MRL-5 radars.

You can view a mirror of their radar at HurricaneCity here. That display contains a longer loop than what the Bahamas radar display has. It also has controls that allow you to pause the image loop, choose the length of the loop and control its speed.

The Bahamas has upgraded its radar capability. In 2016 they signed a contract for four new Doppler radars. As of updating this page for this country in February 2022, three radars are usually available in their composite. While the other two radars seem to have been constructed, we don't know when the data will be available.

While it is difficult to tell what radar sites are available in their radar display because it is all displayed on a map together, their Facebook page has at times shown composite imagery from three radar sites. In a March 2017 press release from the Bahamas government they said "The first one has been established on New Providence and the other three will be in Grand Bahama, Abaco, and Long Island." The first new radar was built about 50 meters southwest from where the old radar was on the island of New Providence. The old radar "will be refurbished and upgraded and then installed in Ragged Island, bringing the total to five Doppler radar, covering the entire country."

The Bahamas has upgraded its radar capability. In 2016 they signed a contract for four new Doppler radars. As of updating this page for this country in February 2022, three radars are usually available in their composite. While the other two radars seem to have been constructed, we don't know when the data will be available.

While it is difficult to tell what radar sites are available in their radar display because it is all displayed on a map together, their Facebook page has at times shown composite imagery from three radar sites. In a March 2017 press release from the Bahamas government they said "The first one has been established on New Providence and the other three will be in Grand Bahama, Abaco, and Long Island." The first new radar was built about 50 meters southwest from where the old radar was on the island of New Providence. The old radar "will be refurbished and upgraded and then installed in Ragged Island, bringing the total to five Doppler radar, covering the entire country."

The location at the coordinates on the map do seem to show a tower in some imagery seen with Google Earth's historical imagery feature. Based on a very old picture from the PDF file here, the meteorological radar might not appear as other radars do. Sometime in 2014 or 2015 a white dome replaced a darker colored dome, likely green, at the radar site 500 meters northwest of these coordinates. That has happened at some of the CINDACTA air traffic control radar sites.

This was listed in the scripting at CEMADEN. Based on the bounds, it was located on Pico da Ibituruna. The only thing I could find was about a temporary 100km radar mentioned in 2014 here. It was to be a temporary radar until one was installed at Santa Tereza. The coordinates are estimated based solely on the bounds they had as it is too hard to find the particular object on the mountain which has many objects.

I was able to measure a small amount of returns from this radar site near 290km. I couldn't tell if that was the edge of the radar. Because most of the other radar sites have a range of 300km, I use that for the range of this radar site.

This radar site is in the WMO Radar Database. It is owned by NIMH according to the WMO Radar Database. Their site is here. I can't find the imagery from the NIMH radar sites online. They link to their weather site here, which mentions radar data in the source code of the page, but we couldn't find any data there.

According to a WMO Radar Database page here, there is also a radar site in Sofia owned by NIMH that is located at the coordinates 42.695 23.4081. Those exact coordinates are for a runway at Sofia Airport. There might have been a radar at 42.700541N 23.406028E, about 640 meters away from the WMO Radar Database's coordinates, but between August 2015 and February 2016 the dome disappeared. The Sofia Airport radar is not on the map as it may not even exist any longer. The WMO Radar Database says it is a C-band radar, but if it is a small X-band radar, it could be located at 42.689377 23.402470, where there appears to be a small radar on top of what appears to be an air traffic control tower. Those coordinates are about 800 meters southwest of the WMO coordinates.

This is a new radar. It was constructed in a different location than the old radar. The old radar was located at 54.913217N 109.959821W. This new radar is about 60km south of where that older radar was. A PDF file here, from November 2018, indicated a few potential sites where the new radar might be built. This radar was built in the backup location noted in that file, Cherry Grove. We haven't been able to find pictures of the new radar. Using coarse satellite imagery from the Sentinel Hub EO Browser, we found a bright spot close to where the new radar was supposed to be built. We used that for the coordinates we chose. In the PDF file on Canada's site, which has coordinates for each radar site, they give coordinates of 54.37888N 110.06138W. Those are less than 15 meters from the coordinates we chose.

This is an addition to Canada's radar network. It did not replace an older radar.

The coordinates for this radar come from a PDF file on Canada's site and we haven't been able to verify them with satellite imagery. Based on the imagery available, it should be rather accurate as there was some activity in the area, some dirt moved, and it should not be more than a few dozen meters off. Also, a picture in the video here of the radar seems to match an existing road seen in satellite imagery and the radar looks to be where the coordinates are.

Halfmoon Peak, British Columbia, Canada
When we checked for information about this radar site in August 2023, the page about modernizing their radar network had a replacement site listed as "Halfmoon Peak, BC (Vancouver Island replacement site) (CASHP)". It seems as though this is the replacement site for the Mount Sicker radar. That site indicated that the radar is on track to be replaced from November 2022 to August 2023. That page also says that "Some radars, such as Mt Sicker (near Victoria BC) will be relocated to improve coverage or for operational reasons."

The coordinates for this radar come from a PDF file on Canada's site and we haven't been able to verify them with satellite imagery.

About the Mount Sicker radar: "Suffered a major hardware failure, will be replaced with a new modern radar and moved to a better location providing improved coverage for the area. The new radar is tentatively planned to be operational in 2023. Until then, the radar image will be displaying data combined from seven neighbouring radar sites (including US radars)." Quote from the "Radar outages and maintenance" page. The date that older radar became unavailable was November 18th, 2017. It used to be located at 48.860914N 123.756639W, about 75km south of the newer radar being built.

This is a new radar. It replaced an older radar that had been at this location. The old radar had to be removed before a new one could be built in its place, so it's likely the coordinates of the newer radar are very close to where the older one was.

This is a training radar that was built in 2020 at the Centre for Atmospheric Research Experiments (CARE). We could not find radar data online for this radar site. It's possible it might be incorporated into the main display for Canada, but we don't know if it is since it is for training purposes.

In 2018, the Blainville radar replaced this radar at McGill University in Canada's radar network. The newer radar is about 32km north. View that location for radar data.

This older radar might still be used for research purposes, but we don't know if typical radar imagery is available online. We link to the main site for the radar. Reflectivity data is no longer on the page it used to be on. (The page no longer exists: https://radar.mcgill.ca/imagery/radar-animation.html) When we checked for imagery in October 2022, we found that while there was current data for some radar products, we don't know if it is from this radar. They have a product, "Nowcasting", that has future radar data for a large area, well beyond the radar site. It's unclear if their radar is integrated into this product to create the forecast. They have radar data for a product called "VertiX", both for a X-band radar and another radar, though it is unclear if that is for the S-band radar or another X-band radar. We do not include the range of this radar on our map.

There are three domes, all on buildings. For the coordinates, I went with the one on the taller building that appears to most likely be the radar. The other two domes are on a building next to the other one that isn't as tall. All of the domes are within about 75 meters of each other. A picture of the radar we have the coordinates for is here. That picture, on the website of China's meteorological service, focuses on the dome we chose. A picture here shows the domes on the other building.

When we checked satellite imagery in Google Earth for this radar site, imagery was most recently available from 2004. We needed to use more recent imagery, from Esri, to find the location of this radar since it was built since then.

Ma'anshan (马鞍山), China
The coordinates for this radar site reflect the coordinates that come from China. There is a radar at these coordinates. However, the imagery on China's site for Ma'anshan has the center crosshairs about 35km away from these coordinates. Based upon radar returns, there definitely appears to be a radar of some sort near the center crosshairs in the image. There is something on a hill at 31.434007 118.346433 that could be an X-band radar. Based on historical satellite imagery, there seems to be an object that spins there. It's around 3km away from the center crosshairs. There could have been a radar about 10km from the center crosshairs at 31.393833 118.404673 at an airport, but whatever dome was there disappeared sometime between March 2019 and December 2020. When we checked this radar site in October 2022, the background did not appear in imagery. That made it impossible to see where the rain actually was and to try to determine where the radar was again.

We do not draw a range on the map for this radar since we don't know exactly where the radar data comes from on the image. China's radar imagery for Ma'anshan previously listed the range as 150km. When we checked in October 2022, it listed 138km.

The location I chose for this radar is a little uncertain. I chose coordinates for what seems to be a radar at an airport. The coordinates are about 1,300 meters away from the China's coordinates (32.0790 120.9620) for the radar. There were other radars that were also off on the coordinates like that, but in this case the coordinates for both the coordinates I selected, and theirs, are about 13km away from the center crosshairs in China's imagery for this radar site. The crosshairs have been wrong for other radar imagery as well, so this radar could still be accurate.

This is likely the location of this radar based on the page here. (site did not load when we tested it in October 2022) It seems like that page says the radar might be around Sanshazhen in Xiapu County. The crosshairs in the radar image is about 11km from this radar location, but given the range of the radar, and how some of the crosshairs for other images have also been incorrect, this might be the correct position.

This is likely the location of this radar based on imagery from the page here. The crosshairs in the radar image on China's site is about 11km from this radar location, but given the range of the radar, the page noted, and how some of the crosshairs for other images have also been incorrect, this is likely the correct position.

The imagery from this radar was available here in the past. There is no date on the imagery, but other radar data on that page was last available in 2016 or 2017. It's uncertain if this radar is still operational or there.

The range noted comes from the OPERA (Operational Programme for the Exchange of Weather Radar Information) database which lists this as the maximum range of this small X-band radar. Because current imagery from the radar couldn't be found online, the range is not noted on the map. The range in the old imagery mentioned above measures at about 110km in Google Earth, but because there are no returns on the image we don't know if the radar actually extends that far. A picture of the small radar can be found in the PDF document here. Based on satellite imagery, and that picture, the coordinates should be very close to the coordinates of the radar. (The coordinates I selected are about 30 meters from the ones in the OPERA database.)

You can learn more about ADRIARadNet, the project this radar was a part of, on the site here. It's possible that an application on the site here might have data, but it requires a password. (when we tested this site in October 2022 it didn't load)

The PDF file mentioned above says that this radar was installed in October 2014. The OPERA database lists the start year as 2014.

Osijek, Croatia
When we tested this radar site in October 2022, imagery was last available on April 4th, 2022. This radar site is no longer listed on their site. A new radar is in Gradište, about 40 km south-southeast. We do not draw the range on the map. Since Croatia is building new radars to cover the entire country, this radar is no longer needed. For now, we will leave it on the map as it might still operate. We will remove it if it is torn down.

Puntijarka, Croatia
A new radar is going to be built, perhaps where the old radar was. The page here, from July 2022, says a new radar will be built at Puntijarka (Medvednica). That is where the old radar is, though we don't know if it will be in the same footprint as the old one.

As for the old radar, it is also no longer listed on their site. Looking at the Internet Archive, this radar site disappeared from the composite sometime in either August or September 2021. We do not draw the range on the map. We currently use the coordinates of the old radar.

Rijeka, Croatia
It's uncertain if this radar is still operational. The coordinates for this radar come from the OPERA (Operational Programme for the Exchange of Weather Radar Information) database. Based on the PDF file here, this is a small X-band FURUNO radar, with a range of 30km, that is located in Rijeka on top of the Civil Engineering building at the University of Rijeka. A picture can be seen here. The PDF file says that this radar was installed in November 2012. The OPERA database lists the start year as 2013.

Uljenje (Pelješac peninsula), Croatia
This radar is under construction as of when we checked in October 2022. A tweet from May 10th, 2022 said that the foundation had been laid. A tweet from October 1st, 2022 again mentioned the foundation. The coordinates we use come from the WMO Radar Database and the OPERA Database. A picture of the foundation seems to be here, posted in June 2022. A few posts below, there also seems to be a picture from far away. Recent enough satellite imagery to see the foundation was not available, but based on the pictures, the coordinates are likely within 25 meters or less of the actual location the radar will be at.

When we checked the radar sites for Cyprus in October 2022, most of the imagery wasn't available. Reflectivity imagery was only available for Larnaca (Aradippou). However, it was only short range imagery with a range of about 175km. Previously, at times, long range imagery was sometimes available that measured around 350km to 360km for the radar sites.In January 2022, reflectivity imagery was current for the Paphos (Nata) radar site and radar data from Larnaca (Aradippou) did not appear to be available on the imagery. Earlier in 2021, imagery did measure about 350km for that radar site as well. Doppler imagery available on that page, which was only shown for the Larnaca (Aradippou) radar site and had a range of 250km, was two weeks old at the time. In October 2022, doppler imagery was from July 2022. Previously, imagery for these radar sites showed a range of 150km.

As of October 2022, we only show a range of 175km for Larnaca.

Jihlava, Czechia (alternate link)
Meteopress and Idokep.hu have installed over two dozen weather radars. We have very few on our map because we don't know where they are. The WMO Radar Database had some of them listed and those are the ones we have added.

From the page here, their network may not operate unless there are strong storms. Part of it seems to translate to: "When do we launch our weather radar: when there are strong storms or heavy precipitation over the Czech Republic". That page also says the range of their radars is 250km, though we don't know if that is the range they display. An older post here goes into more detail on their network. From that page it doesn't seem like all of their radars, if any, have a range of 250km when it comes to what they actually display. But that page is older and their newer radars might have a greater range. We do not draw the range on our map, but we do list the ranges as 250km for now.

When we checked that first page in October 2022, they listed the radars they have as:
8 in the Czech Republic: Prague, Pilsen, Rakovník, Jihlava, Mladá Boleslav, Soběslav, Olomouc, Znojmo
13 in Hungary
1 in Austria - Vienna
3 in Slovakia: Bratislava, Lučenec, Spišská Nová Ves
1 in Croatia – Medulin
other radars are being prepared, for example in Austria, Croatia or Serbia
When we checked for their radar data in October 2022, it was blank on the site of Idokep.hu. It wasn't clear if it was integrated into Meteopress' display, as it also includes data from other countries in Europe that have their own radars.

Zacatecoluca, El Salvador
We were unable to verify the location of this radar. While a few aspects of the picture in the PDF file matches pictures and satellite imagery of the coordinates in the scripting of their website, many don't. It's possible that the top of the building has changed since the picture was taken. Even a building across the street has similar features on top, so it's possible this radar might not be on the building noted.

The WMO Radar Database coordinates are only about 15 meters away from the ones from El Salvador. We use the coordinates from El Salvador.

When we added this radar site in October 2022, high resolution satellite imagery from June 2019 showed concrete that was laid and the new road to the radar site. A small circle was in the middle of that new area built. We use that for our coordinates. We also used the Sentinel Hub EO Browser to search for low resolution imagery and it matched well with the coordinates we selected. The radar should not be more than 20 meters off from the actual coordinates.

Kutaisi, Georgia
While Georgia has multiple radars, I couldn't find current data from them online. Sakaeronavigatsia, a Georgian air navigation service provider, seems to own the radars in Tbilisi and Poti. Georgia's National Environment Agency (NEA) seems to operate these radars with them.

An additional radar that seems like it will be owned by Sakaeronavigatsia and operated by NEA, for Kutaisi, is too recent to find on the latest publicly available high resolution satellite imagery. Based on some information, it seems like the radar was to be built at the Kutaisi airport. Some documentation indicates that it was to be built at the old airport. Based on some low resolution imagery we could find and some pictures that might show the radar site under construction, it's possible that radar might be around 42.247689 42.624574 at the old airport. We don't currently have that radar site on the map.

A radar for anti-hail purposes is located near Sighnaghi and seems to be managed by the Ministry of Defense of Georgia. Information can be found here and here.

Because imagery doesn't appear to currently be online, we don't have and ranges drawn for the radars on the map.

If imagery ever becomes available online, one of the following sites might possibly have it: https://airnav.ge/, https://meteo.airnav.ge/, https://nea.gov.ge/ge/, http://meteo.gov.ge/ and https://www.hydromet.ge/

250km range loops are available for many radars in India, with a shorter range loop also usually available. Most radars have a range of 500km that you can view imagery for in the image section, which we link to in the first link. That is separate from the "animations" section where you can view loops, which we link to in the second link. The image section contains additional imagery for the radars.

Chennai (X-band), India
This is an X-band radar that seems to have started operating in 2021. Since then, another radar that is about 17.5km north-northeast of this one, in Chennai, has been upgraded.

Before the radar in Chennai was upgraded, this radar did have imagery on their site. However, it was not linked from their map when we checked in October 2022. We do not draw the range since we couldn't find imagery online, though this radar may also continue to be in operation.

Denpasar, Indonesia
We were able to measure returns out to 200km in individual imagery, though it is unclear if that is the maximum available. In archived images from 2016 at the Internet Archive, the larger map on BMKG's main radar page also had imagery in which we could measure the range. The range appeared to be about 250km on the large map. However, that was an older version of their map.

This radar is related to rain enhancement. You can learn more about that here. When we checked this radar site in September 2020, the map didn't load properly because the Mapbox token wasn't valid and the map didn't load. Imagery wasn't current, about three days old. We were able to download a radar scan and get the bounds of the image from the source of the page. We then added the overlay to Google Earth and were able to measure the range of the radar as being about 165km. The range is not currently drawn on our map.

Click the "Radar" link on the page to view data. When we checked this radar site in September 2020 the radar said "Radar stopped due to technical maintenance". An article here and here talks about how the radar failed in 2018, but I don't know if it came back online after that. For now, the range is not included on our map.

Brindisi, Italy
The location of this radar is uncertain. It may no longer exist. The WMO Radar Database has coordinates of 40.6497N 17.9497E. The OPERA database has coordinates of 40.65N 17.95E. We chose a location that is about 1.3km from those coordinates. A picture of some kind of radar can be seen in Google Street View here from February 2011. By August 2012, it was gone. The radar was one that looked something like this, without a dome, based on the PDF file here from 2002. We found various towers around, but none seemed to have a radar when we checked satellite and Google Street View imagery in October 2022. (40.648303N 17.949672E, 40.651305N 17.945378E, 40.652159N 17.943928E, 40.658912N 17.940743E) We also looked at previous imagery.

We're not sure if the radar data from most of the Italian Air Force's radars is available online. The locations for these radars come from the WMO Radar Database. We do not know the ranges of these radars and we therefore do not draw the ranges on the map.

Catania, Italy
This is a mobile X-band radar. The range is estimated to be 100km. The mobile radar in Reggio Calabria has a range of 100km based on measuring the returns in imagery from the DPC's site. Because there are other radars with a further range nearby in the composite on the DPC's site, it isn't possible to determine what range is available from imagery from this radar site. An article here gives a range of 80km for both this site and Reggio Calabria, but the ranges shown for both in that article measure at 100km. We use 100km on our map.

However, when translating the Japanese to English, it translates to Taguchiyama Elementary School. Some other things nearby have Taguchiyama as well. That is what we go with as the alternate name.

Kadena AFB, Japan (alternate link)
There are two NEXRAD radar sites in South Korea, and one in Japan, at U.S. military bases. When working, radar data from these sites is available in real time, but not many sites have the imagery and underlying basemap. NOAA's radar display, which we link to, lists these three radar sites. However, we have never been able to view radar returns in that display. (even when the icon in the display isn't red) We last tested their display in October 2022. Also, there is no low-bandwidth imagery for these radar sites on their standard display page page like for radar sites in U.S. states and territories.

The only site we have found that has had current data in the past, and an underlying basemap, is the one we link to in the alternate link, but the ability to view a loop doesn't work.

The July 30th, 2019 installation date noted on the WMO Radar Database page for these radars is likely when the page was updated since four radars share that same date, in Japan, South Korea and Guam, and these radars existed before then.

Their radar doesn't appear to be publicly available in real-time yet. They do post radar imagery to their Facebook page occasionally. An example is here. In 2018, some people asked about getting the link and their response was, translated using Google Translate: "The radar belongs to the Meteorological Department and is now under test. The link to it cannot currently be published." We do not currently draw the range for this radar on our map. There is a page here that translates as being titled "Air Radar". It has said it is "Under Construction" since 2016. It's uncertain if that is the page it might be added to. This newer radar was built in 2017. The English language version of their website is here, though as of checking their site they don't have that "Air Radar" page in that version of their site.

Imagery from this radar site doesn't appear to be on Malaysia's site. This radar site is about 35km south-southeast from another radar site which is located nearer to Kuala Lumpur. Measuring the ranges of imagery available in the composite image on their site, it appears that the other radar site is the one contributing imagery to the composite on their site. This radar site is about 8km north-northwest of Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Because imagery doesn't appear to be available, the range is not known and no range is shown on the map.

Radar imagery doesn't appear to be available in real time. You can view their meteorological service at the link above. On occasion, they post radar imagery through social media, on Facebook and Twitter. You can find examples here and here. There were returns out to about 300km in that imagery. Because imagery is not available in real time, and rarely posted to social media, we don't draw the range on the map.

They have an app that references radar imagery in it but it has a message that says "Radar images not available". You can download it here: Google Play (Android) | Apple App Store (iOS)

It appears that these radars might be used in part for cloud seeding efforts. The page here has pictures of what appears to be another radar, one in Koutiala, though I didn't know where to look so I couldn't find it in satellite imagery and it is therefore not on the map.

In October 2022, when we reviewed the radar data for Guanajuato, current imagery was available.

This radar is one of two radars in the Mexican state of Guanajuato. The data from both radars are in a single composite image. The image says the range is 100 nautical miles. In measuring some of the returns it does seem like this is the range of at least one of the radars, if not both. However, the range of the El Moro radar goes beyond what the composite image has, extending further south. A circle on the image of the composite doesn't represent the true range of available data. In testing, we found returns in the lower left corner of the image that were beyond the circle and measured 100 nautical miles from the El Moro radar site. For simplicity, we still show a 100 nautical mile circle for the El Moro radar.

Imagery doesn't appear to be publicly available. Their old site's front page had a link that was named "Harta radar comună ANM și SHS" (Google Translate: Joint radar map ANM and SHS). Those are the abbreviations of Moldova's and Romania's meteorological services and the link was to Romania's radar display here. I couldn't find evidence that this radar, built in 2013, might be integrated into Romania's display. Because I don't know the range of any possible publicly available imagery, no range is shown on the map.

Radar imagery does not seem to be publicly available as of updating this page for this country in October 2022. Looking back in the Internet Archive to their older meteorological service's site, from since at least 2011 to sometime in 2020, their site had the same message on this page about needing to upgrade their radar network. You can find example imagery from their radar here, again from an older version of their site, which talks about a range of 240km, at least for some of their radars.

A previous version of their site made it seem like imagery might be available, but you had to add it to their cart, which wasn't working when we tried it at that time. On their current site, we could not find that option. We do see a brief mention of their radars on the page we link to, but no imagery is available on that page.

A new radar might have been installed, or may be installed, around Tan Tan Airport according to the WMO Radar Database. A new structure was constructed nearby, at 28.443259N 11.158071W, that could be the new radar. However, nothing has appeared on the tower yet. There was nothing there in June 2020. In October 2020 there was. In July 2021, there was a tower. In July 2022, there was still nothing on the tower when we checked in October 2022. There is also some kind of object, which could be a small radar, at 28.444860N 11.158182W. It's only 18 meters from the WMO's coordinates, but we couldn't find any pictures of the parking lot at Tan Tan Airport to see.

The WMO Radar Database also mentions a radar for Arfoud (Erfoud) on the page here, but the coordinates are for Tan Tan, so we don't know where this one might be.

That older imagery did not include imagery from their other radar sites, though we link to that radar page for all Nepal radar sites. We do not draw the range on the map for any of Nepal's sites.

Their radar network is new, with the three radars currently on our map seemingly built in 2019 or 2020. You can click here for their Department of Hydrology and Meteorology and here for their Meteorological Forecasting Division.

The first radar built, in Ratanangla, Surkhet, was dedicated on December 3rd, 2019. Because the radars are so new, recent enough free high resolution satellite imagery wasn't clear enough to determine the exact location of the other two radar sites. Since we could see construction at the other two site on satellite imagery, the actual coordinates are likely less than 25 meters from the coordinates we selected.

It doesn't appear as though Nigeria's radars are currently available online. In checking this country's website for radar data in March 2021, a radar loop on their front page from their Port Harcourt radar was from 2019. Based on the name and directory of the video file, it may have been posted in January or February of 2020.

There are weather radars at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (Abuja) and Port Harcourt International Airport (Port Harcourt). There may be four additional radars that are not mapped. (based on undated information here and from other sources) They may be in Kano, Lagos, Maiduguri and Yola. Because we couldn't find imagery online, the ranges are not known.

The WMO Radar Database lists this radar site as "Planned". Based on satellite imagery, construction on a tower started around January 2015 or a little before. Based on satellite imagery through 2020, it doesn't appear as though a dome is at the top of the tower. There appears to be a hole in the center of the platform at the top based on the sun shining through it and not having a shadow on the ground for the center of the platform. This radar site may not be finished.

As of checking this radar site in October 2022, imagery was last manually added on October 25th, 2015. The imagery for this radar says that the range is 300km, but some of the returns in the image seem to be beyond that, perhaps closer to 400km.

For Pakistan's radars, we link to their main radar page in the first link. The second link is a direct link to that same imagery. In case the location of imagery changes, we include both links. Most of Pakistan's radars do not have imagery that is automatically posted. It must be posted manually. As of checking the radar data for this country in September 2022, only Islamabad and Karachi, had imagery that was automatically updated. We only drew the range on the map for radars that had data from the past day when we checked them.

The document here has a plan to construct additional radars, with ones in Multan (2023) and Sukkur (2024) planned. Additional radars are planned, but the "prospect of funding is not yet confirmed" for the others listed in that document.

The range is not drawn on our map. When we checked this radar site in October 2022, a screenshot of a computer screen that had data had a clock on the computer that had a date of September 29th, 2022. When checking earlier in September 2022, imagery was last available on May 15th, 2022.

There is some uncertainty with the location of Mangla's radar. There might be two radars, but I couldn't find information saying there was. Documents here (July 2020, PDF page 30) and here (March 2013, PDF page 44), as well as coordinates from the WMO Radar Database, seem to indicate that what looks like it could be a radar at 33.066265 73.633037 is the radar. The first document says the radar was installed in 2004. The second document gives the establishment year as 2007. Based on satellite imagery, this radar was likely built in 2010 or earlier. Imagery from 2006 doesn't seem to show it, but the imagery isn't clear enough. The coordinates are essentially the same however, with the radar also being described as an S-band radar established, or with financial support provided by, the Asian Development Bank (ADB). However, imagery doesn't seem to line up with radar data being from a possible radar there. The coordinates we select are for a radar that is pictured in the document here on the WMO's site and in a picture here that seems to line up well with available radar imagery. It lines up with imagery we found through the Internet Archive from 2015. That radar also seems to have been built sometime between 2006 and 2010 based on satellite imagery. We do not map the radar, if it is one, that does not line up with radar imagery. That possible radar is located about 7km south-southwest of the coordinates we selected. The WMO Radar Database page for the Mangla radar is here, but we don't know which one that is for. The first PDF document we mentioned above, from July 2020, says the Mangla radar mentioned in that file was manufactured by the Enterprise Electronics Corporation (EEC). The WMO Radar Database page also says the same.

Radar data for this site is added manually, so it doesn't update too often. When we checked this radar site in October 2022 and Septemeber 2022, only a screenshot of a computer display was available that was from the prior day. When we checked this radar site in September 2020, an image was available that appeared to be less than 6 hours old when we looked at it. It was not a screenshot of a computer display at that time. The range is based on the size of available imagery. We were also able to measure returns between 230km and 240km from the radar site. A picture of this radar site is in the document here.

The coordinates we use are based on the picture from the document above. Other sources, including the WMO Radar Database, have the radar as being located up to 4km away. However, there appears to be no radar near the coordinates from other sources. One of the sources shows the radar as being at the Seerat Study Centre, but a picture of that location shows that it is not a radar dome. Satellite imagery was clear enough to match the picture above to the coordinates we select, with the stairs even visible in some satellite imagery.

A news release here from Baron Weather seems to indicate that there might be a new radar in 2023. It says: "The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) has selected Baron Weather, Inc, the worldwide leader in superior weather intelligence, to provide a cutting-edge weather radar system and data display technology that will play a vital role in the safety of shipping operations. In 2023, Baron will install a GEN3 850kW S-band dual-polarization radar. The radar will be located in south-central Panama, near where the Panama Canal and the Pacific Ocean meet." We don't know if it would replace this one or if it would be in addition to this one.

We list the range as 100km for now and do not draw the range on the map. You can find some more information about this radar site here.

Based on a tweet here, other radars might be installed by the Servicio Nacional de Meteorología e Hidrología del Perú (SENAMHI). Translated by Google: "#SENAMHI Executive President, Patricio Valderrama indicated that the purchase of radar and hydrometeorological stations for the Early Warning System for rains in Piura will soon be carried out. Equipment installation is expected to take place in the first months of 2023".

As of 2022, there is also a mobile radar (SOPHy) from Peru's Jicamarca Radio Observatory. You can see various information: Articles (here and here), Twitter thread, YouTube. You can see some data in the pictures and video. It seems like it was probably linked from this page at the time, but it is no longer there. We saved a snapshot of the page that here, though it doesn't contain imagery. In that Twitter thread, in the tweet here, it says it would be installed in the Mantaro valley.

The range from this radar is estimated. We use the range for other S-band Magnetron radars in the PDF file.

We're unsure if this radar is active yet. We do not draw the range.

The coordinates for this radar are a little uncertain. When we added this radar site in October 2022, high resolution satellite inagery was available from November 2020. It showed what looked to be a tower, that was under construction, that was like some of the other radar towers in the Philippines. A document here said the radar was located in "Brgy. Patad, Bario Boboy, Agno, Pangasinan."

You can view their main site here. Their interactive map contains a composite of their radars. The ranges of their radars seem to vary. Because they no longer seem to have the ability to view imagery for a radar site individually, we're unsure of the range of available imagery for many of their radar sites.

PAGASA's old site had individual imagery for each radar site in which the range was clear. While the current site does have the ability to view individual imagery for each radar site, it's on a dynamic map. Some of the individual sites have showed small returns well away from a radar site. We haven't been able to observe enough returns to determine if some of the furthest returns are accurate. For some radar sites we will have additional information preceding this section that is specific to a radar site.

Ranges we use either come from the document here, are an educated guess or are estimated based on measuring radar returns in the composite. If using the PDF document, we use the "Volume Range" in the PDF file. The "Max Range" might be 440km, 480km or 500km, depending on the radar site, but we don't know if they have that range available publicly.

We do not know which of their sites are active, and which are not, since the imagery appears in a composite. A meteorologist at a news network in the Philippines said in a tweet here in July 2022 that 7 radars were down at that time. They were: Basco, Aparri, Baguio, Virac, Iloilo, Zamboanga, Tampakan. We still draw the range for all their radars unless otherwise noted.

You can view their main site here. Their interactive map contains a composite of their radars. The ranges of their radars seem to vary. Because they no longer seem to have the ability to view imagery for a radar site individually, we're unsure of the range of available imagery for many of their radar sites.

PAGASA's old site had individual imagery for each radar site in which the range was clear. While the current site does have the ability to view individual imagery for each radar site, it's on a dynamic map. Some of the individual sites have showed small returns well away from a radar site. We haven't been able to observe enough returns to determine if some of the furthest returns are accurate. For some radar sites we will have additional information preceding this section that is specific to a radar site.

Ranges we use either come from the document here, are an educated guess or are estimated based on measuring radar returns in the composite. If using the PDF document, we use the "Volume Range" in the PDF file. The "Max Range" might be 440km, 480km or 500km, depending on the radar site, but we don't know if they have that range available publicly.

There might be another Oradea radar right next to this one, within about 15 meters. It is colored like an MRL-5 radar.

In addition to that, there is another Oradea radar about 7km away, at 47.092133N 21.942904E. In the OPERA database that radar is listed in its archive, though it doesn't include an end year. Romania's site, the WMO Radar Database and OPERA database have coordinates for the current radar within 350 meters or less of the actual coordinates of the radar. The elevation for this radar more closely matches the elevation listed in the WMO Radar Database for the Oradea radar. The radar tower here closely matches other radars from the same manufacturer that are installed in Romania. For these reasons, this seems to be the Oradea radar that is listed in the WMO Radar Database and we link to that page.

Russia's radar data has become less public than it used to be. For the most part, only a composite is available for radars in western Russia. Russia is upgrading their radar network and there is likely many radars we do not include on our map. We assume that every range is 250km for all active radars. This is based on measuring some of the radar ranges in the composite imagery. It was too difficult to determine which radars were active by looking at just the composite imagery. We instead used the first quarter of 2022 report on the page here. Out of the radars in that report, we do not know the locations of the Oryol, Pskov, Chelyabinsk, Perm (a newer one) and Yoshkar-Ola radars and they are therefore not on our map. As for old radars, we never could find the radar for Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk which was referenced on the old page archived here.

Russia's radar data has become less public than it used to be. For the most part, only a composite is available for radars in western Russia. Russia is upgrading their radar network and there is likely many radars we do not include on our map. We assume that every range is 250km for all active radars. This is based on measuring some of the radar ranges in the composite imagery. It was too difficult to determine which radars were active by looking at just the composite imagery. We instead used the first quarter of 2022 report on the page here.

We instead used the first quarter of 2022 report on the page here. Out of the radars in that report, we do not know the locations of the Oryol, Pskov, Chelyabinsk, Perm (a newer one) and Yoshkar-Ola radars and they are therefore not on our map.

There might be two radars. We chose the newer dome, which appeared sometime between 2014 and 2016 based on satellite imagery, for the coordinates we chose. The older dome, which is about 40 meters to the north-northeast, existed at least since 2008 based on available imagery. The coordinates for that one are 44.476060 41.398262. Since we don't know which location is the radar in the WMO Radar Database, we do not include the page id. You can view that page here.

Saint Petersburg (KONTUR-NIIRS), Russia
The location of this radar is uncertain. This is likely a small radar on top of a building. You can see what might be it on Google Street View here. There are two small objects that might be the radar. We selected the one that might more likely be the radar. We found this using the business address on the website that has the radar image. The location we selected doesn't seem to quite line up with the imagery, so we are unsure if this is the correct location. We're unsure of the range. While there is imagery for this particular radar site, the image extends beyond the circles that are drawn. The largest circle would indicate a range of about 250km.

Russia's radar data has become less public than it used to be. For the most part, only a composite is available for radars in western Russia. Russia is upgrading their radar network and there is likely many radars we do not include on our map. We assume that every range is 250km for all active radars. This is based on measuring some of the radar ranges in the composite imagery. It was too difficult to determine which radars were active by looking at just the composite imagery. We instead used the first quarter of 2022 report on the page here.

The range seems to be about 70km based on radar returns from the last imagery available, though the OPERA database lists the range for this radar as 60km.

According to the WMO Radar Database, this is a WSR-74S radar. The WMO Radar Database lists Princess Juliana International Airport in the name, specifically Juliana Airport, and it seems to sit on a hill about 3km east-northeast of the airport. We do not know if it is still in use. We could not find imagery for it online and do not know its range. We link to their meteorological service. The Facebook page for their meteorological service is here.

Radar data from South Africa does not appear to be available freely to the general public in a way like other countries provide data. A radar storm tracker page exists, but it only draws, in red, the shape of where a current storm is. In orange is what appears to be where the storm is forecast to be in 30 minutes. In yellow is what appears to be where the storm is forecast to be in 60 minutes. (This seems to be explained on this page when talking about the weather API they have through their partner AfriGIS) They also have a satellite page here that has an image that has some data colored like rain, but it might just be colorized based on satellite IR data.

It appears that you need to be a "Valid Aviation User" in order to register for the site to view more detailed imagery. You can read more about that on their subscription page here. It says that "until a pay-portal is implemented access to the site will be limited to aviation users meeting the requirements above." In the charts on that page it says that radar imagery, either national or provincial, will not be free when the pay-portal is implemented. For now someone can access that data only if they are a "Valid Aviation User" which is defined as "Operating in or from South African Airspace" and seems to apply to people, such as pilots, and businesses related to aviation. Our map does not display the ranges of the radar sites from their meteorological service since the data is not the same as what is freely available from other countries. Their radar sites seem to each have "a range of about 200 km" based on the radar section of the weather API they have through their partner AfriGIS. In 2010 and earlier they did provide radar data similar to other countries. At that time, some radar sites had imagery that had a range of 300km.

Radar data from South Africa does not appear to be available freely to the general public in a way like other countries provide data. A radar storm tracker page exists, but it only draws, in red, the shape of where a current storm is. In orange is what appears to be where the storm is forecast to be in 30 minutes. In yellow is what appears to be where the storm is forecast to be in 60 minutes. (This seems to be explained on this page when talking about the weather API they have through their partner AfriGIS) They also have a satellite page here that has an image that has some data colored like rain, but it might just be colorized based on satellite IR data.

It appears that you need to be a "Valid Aviation User" in order to register for the site to view more detailed imagery. You can read more about that on their subscription page here. It says that "until a pay-portal is implemented access to the site will be limited to aviation users meeting the requirements above." In the charts on that page it says that radar imagery, either national or provincial, will not be free when the pay-portal is implemented. For now someone can access that data only if they are a "Valid Aviation User" which is defined as "Operating in or from South African Airspace" and seems to apply to people, such as pilots, and businesses related to aviation. Our map does not display the ranges of the radar sites from their meteorological service since the data is not the same as what is freely available from other countries. Their radar sites seem to each have "a range of about 200 km" based on the radar section of the weather API they have through their partner AfriGIS. In 2010 and earlier they did provide radar data similar to other countries. At that time, some radar sites had imagery that had a range of 300km.

NWU Lekwena Radar on Lekwena Wildlife Estate, South Africa
Sometimes we don't include the range of this radar on our map because it is often not available. Make sure to check the date if the imagery loads. "The NWU Lekwena radar is a test bed for students to learn and develop creative solutions related to weather forecasting and now-casting. This means that the Radar can be switched off for maintenance or it could be broken on purpose in the name of learning. The radar should not be used as a tool to make any severe weather alerts as the South-African Weather Service is the only credible institution to do this. The radar should only be viewed as a tool for the development of young scientists and something interesting to look at."

Camp Humphreys, South Korea (alternate link)
There are two NEXRAD radar sites in South Korea, and one in Japan, at U.S. military bases. When working, radar data from these sites is available in real time, but not many sites have the imagery and underlying basemap. NOAA's radar display, which we link to, lists these three radar sites. However, we have never been able to view radar returns in that display. (even when the icon in the display isn't red) We last tested their display in October 2022. Also, there is no low-bandwidth imagery for these radar sites on their standard display page page like for radar sites in U.S. states and territories.

The only site we have found that has had current data in the past, and an underlying basemap, is the one we link to in the alternate link, but the ability to view a loop doesn't work.

The July 30th, 2019 installation date noted on the WMO Radar Database page for these radars is likely when the page was updated since four radars share that same date, in Japan, South Korea and Guam, and these radars existed before then.

This radar was previously located at 36.959345 127.019082. The page in the WMO Radar Database for this radar was updated to include coordinates that were closer to the new radar site. (we don't know what other data was updated) The July 30th, 2019 installation date noted on that page is likely when the page was updated since four radars share that same date. (in Japan, South Korea and Guam) It was moved in 2007 to its new location. You can read about that here. The coordinates of the new location were found using the "Advanced Search" here where they were listed as 37°12'27.25"N 127°17'08.02"E.

Gangneung, South Korea
At least part of this radar was replaced in 2019. A translated message at the time said "Observations will be discontinued between May 29 and November 2019 due to Gangneung weather radar replacement." We still link to the WMO radar database for the older radar since the tower hasn't changed. At the time of checking this radar site, the WMO radar database had a date of 2010, so parts of their page will therefore be invalid if that is still the case.

The range of individual imagery for this particular radar site is 280km. The range on composite imagery is 480km.

A journal article here from 2021 discusses the radars in Taiwan's radar network. We heavily rely on some of the information in that document. From that article:

The "Taiwan weather radar network started with four S-band Doppler single-polarization radars (RCWF, RCCG, RCKT, and RCHL; Fig. 1), which were deployed between 1996 and 2002."

"The first three C-band dual-polarization (C-pol) radars (RCCK, RCMK, and RCGI; Fig. 1) being integrated into the CWB weather radar network were from the Taiwan Air Force, two of them (RCCK and RCMK) in 2009 and one (RCGI) in 2016. Since 2016, four additional C-pol radars (RCMD, RCLY, RCNT, RCSL; Fig. 1) have been deployed island-wide to further improve the low-level radar coverage, among which the RCMD is a special radar collocated with RCWF for the calibration, training, and scan strategy design of the C-pol radars. Two more C-pol radars (RCYU, RCYI; Fig. 1) will be deployed in the next 3 years."

"The current operational network (Table 1) consists of one S-band dual-polarization (RCWF), three S-band single-polarization (RCHL, RCCG, and RCKT) and six C-pol (RCCK, RCMK, RCGI, RCLY, RCNT, and RCSL) radars."

"And all radars are maintained by CWB except for RCCK, RCMK, and RCGI, which are maintained by the Taiwan Air Force."In the document here you can find information on the ranges of some of the radars which we don't include ranges for.

"The first three C-band dual-polarization (C-pol) radars (RCCK, RCMK, and RCGI; Fig. 1) being integrated into the CWB weather radar network were from the Taiwan Air Force, two of them (RCCK and RCMK) in 2009 and one (RCGI) in 2016. Since 2016, four additional C-pol radars (RCMD, RCLY, RCNT, RCSL; Fig. 1) have been deployed island-wide to further improve the low-level radar coverage, among which the RCMD is a special radar collocated with RCWF for the calibration, training, and scan strategy design of the C-pol radars. Two more C-pol radars (RCYU, RCYI; Fig. 1) will be deployed in the next 3 years."

"The current operational network (Table 1) consists of one S-band dual-polarization (RCWF), three S-band single-polarization (RCHL, RCCG, and RCKT) and six C-pol (RCCK, RCMK, RCGI, RCLY, RCNT, and RCSL) radars."

"And all radars are maintained by CWB except for RCCK, RCMK, and RCGI, which are maintained by the Taiwan Air Force."In the document here you can find information on the ranges of some of the radars which we don't include ranges for.

The location of this radar site is changing. Based on low resolution satellite imagery, it appears that it is likely moving to around 23.159409N 120.076447E. That location is about 1.7km northwest of where the radar site is moving from. Those coordinates that we will eventually use, unless we get better satellite imagery, might be up to about 150 meters off. Based upon pictures of the groundbreaking, and low resolution satellite imagery, we think the coordinates we chose are within a few dozen meters of the new radar site. The new radar site will likely become active sometime in 2022. We're uncertain if the old radar equipment will be moved from the old radar site or if there will be new radar equipment at the new site.

You can see pictures and/or videos of the groundbreaking in 2019 on the new radar site here, here and here. An article from September 7th, 2021 here has a picture of the construction in progress.

There were two domes at this location that seemed to have radars. The dome on a shorter tower disappeared by November 2020. The dome on the taller tower, which we use for coordinates, disappeared sometime between August 2021 and January 2022. However, an orange platform appeared in satellite imagery from January 2022 and was still there in Google Street View imagery from July 2022. Since that platform was new, it's possible that a new radar might be constructed at some point, though a radar already exists about 24km away. We leave this radar site in our database for now and we don't draw the range.

The location of this radar is uncertain. This is a mobile radar based on the page here. Based on a picture here that might be the radar, we think it might be located at the coordinates we chose. Satellite imagery was not detailed enough to know for sure. In October 2022, we were able to see satellite imagery from March 2017. We were able to seemingly match the two tall poles and the smaller dish on the ground. However, the buildings

In October 2022, when we finally found this radar site, we found that it was torn down. It had been an X-band radar. It was in satellite imagery from December 2020, but was gone in January 2022. The radar was at a meteorological station. There had been an X-band radar in Mae Hong Son, but sometime between 2020 and 2022 they built an upgraded radar. We'll leave this radar site on the map for now in case that happens with this one too. You can view a picture of what this radar site looked like here.

When we checked Trinidad and Tobago's site in October 2022, their main radar on Trinidad island wasn't working. You could view an image on the page here that said "Radar is currently down for repair & maintenance. Apologies for any inconvenience." The main link for the radar gives an "Access denied" message. We do not draw the range on the map.

They are trying to repair their main radar based on articles here and here. The first article also mentions an X-band Ranger X5 radar from Enterprise Electronics Corporation (EEC). This is a radar in Crown Point on Tobago island. A PDF document here (PDF page 131) shows a close-up picture of it. A new meteorological building opened in 2017. You can view some pictures and video here of the building. We were able to find satellite imagery from December 2021 that showed some additional detail that other satellite imagery didn't provide of the top of that new building. While not clear, it seemed like there might have been a tile path on top of the building. If so, that matches with the image of the small X-band radar in the PDF file. In satellite imagery from April 2022, a small object appeared on the roof that is likely the X-band radar, but it wasn't detailed enough to determine definitively. Therefore, it remains a little uncertain. Data from this radar did not seem to be online when we checked.

For the range of the X-band radar, we use a range of 150km that was mentioned in the first article, though we're uncertain what it might be if imagery is eventually made available online.

Radar data from the United Arab Emirates is available in composite imagery on an interactive map. This makes it hard to determine which radar sites are active. However, the code of their page does allow them to note which radars are not working. While they don't denote a status of "on" or "off" for their radars, and do for international radars, we do draw the range for each of their radars listed on their map. The code of the page indicates the range of each radar listed is 250km, aside Gasyoura which is 220km.

Gasyoura, United Arab Emirates
This radar seems to be a mobile radar. The coordinates we selected are less than 10 meters from the coordinates on UAE's website. Satellite imagery seems to show something parked on a roadway that looks like a mobile radar. The range is also listed as 220km on their site, less than their radars that have a range of 250km, so it likely is a mobile radar.

UAE has a mobile radar listed in the WMO Radar Database. We don't know if that is this one, but since the timing would work out from the install date listed in the WMO Radar Database, we do link to that page in the database.

Liwa Oasis (Mezaira / Mezairaa / Muzaira), United Arab Emirates
There appears to be some kind of smaller tower, built sometime between 2015 and 2018, 300 meters to the south-southwest. We selected the larger tower for coordinates. The radar for this location has been around since at least 2003 or earlier based on satellite imagery, though we don't know if another one could have been constructed. It's uncertain, but a picture of the radar tower we have coordinates for might be here. The radar on that website is not named, but seems to match somewhat with the location.

The Dean Hill radar replaced this one in 2005 according to the article here. However, as of August 2022 the dome and tower were still there. The WMO Radar Database lists this radar as having been installed in 1988. It lists its operating status as "Non-reporting". We list this radar as being "closed" since the U.K. site says the Dean Hill radar replaced this one. The OPERA database does not list this radar.

Redstone Arsenal (RSA), Alabama, U.S.
This is a Baron Weather S-Band radar for Redstone Arsenal, a U.S. Army post. We have not found data online for this radar.

A PDF document here says Baron Weather "worked with the U.S. Army's Redstone Arsenal to upgrade their legacy radar to a Baron S-band system, then to dual-polarization on a staged multi-year plan". An article here from Baron Weather said "Baron has supported military operations globally with radars and other weather technology, including the installation of radars at Fort Greely in Alaska and Redstone Arsenal in Alabama."

Note: We only draw ranges for NEXRAD and TDWR radars in the United States. Most of the other radars in the United States are from television stations. It is too difficult to determine what the range of publicly available imagery is for other radars. It is often difficult to even determine if the other radars have data available online. Many of the television station websites use interactive maps that contain data from across the United States. Their websites often do not seem to include data from their own radar. Even if they have other imagery, it is not always clear if it is from their own radar. It would also make the map too cluttered to draw even more ranges on the map for the United States.

UAH ARMOR Radar / WHNT-TV, Alabama, U.S.
ARMOR stands for "Advanced Radar for Meteorological and Operational Research".

You can learn more about this radar here. You can view a Wikipedia article on this radar here. A PDF file here says that this radar is "used concurrently by operational meteorologists at WHNT-TV (partner in upgrade) and the Huntsville National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Office. Radar data and derived products are provided to WHNT and NWS for warning decision support and training purposes."

Based on radar returns, and the size of the radar imagery, both as measured in Google Earth, it seems the range of available imagery for this radar is about 120km. That is based on imagery from UAH at the link above. If imagery from this radar is available elsewhere, the available range might be more.

The FCC license for this radar is here.

We were unable to find radar data on WHNT's weather page that looks to come from this radar site. Based on the FCC license here, WHNT also has their own radar as well.

The following is a default message we include for many of the television station radars in the United States. For many of these radars, we are unable to determine if the radar is still in use. It's also difficult to determine if data from these radars is available online. Many of the TV stations have websites that have dynamic maps, usually from The Weather Company. These maps usually do not contain an overlay that contains radar data for the radar that the TV station may own. Sometimes the TV stations also have additional radar imagery, such as an image loop of their area. They might have multiple images with various close-up views in their viewing area. In these instances it's often very difficult to determine which TV stations have radar data from their own radar online. (unless we can determine from the imagery where the data seems to be originating from, either by the radar site being marked or through radar returns) For these stations we usually link to their website's main weather page. The main weather page may have multiple radar views, including an interactive radar map and possibly other radar imagery as well. Even though some of these sites have a dedicated radar page, often that radar page only has the interactive radar map and not the other radar imagery that could contain data from their radar. Just because we link to a site doesn't mean that the radar data from that radar is available online. It's too complex to try to determine definitively, without contacting various TV stations, if their radar data is available online. If we did additional research, we may also include that additional information before this paragraph. Some of these TV stations will use their radar data in their own coverage, either on television or through their social media. If we come across information that suggests that, we will provide it. But due to the number of stations, we don't do much research trying to determine if these radars are used in that way. We do not draw ranges on the map for these radars.

The coordinates we selected are about 120 meters from where the FCC license here has this radar at. There is a dome, which you can see here, on a tall building that is likely the radar. The FCC license says this radar is on a building and it seems that the building is about 49 meters tall. That matches well with this building.

Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR)
NOAA: RIDGE2 Display

To select a TDWR site from the front page of NOAA's radar display, you have to first select a regular NEXRAD site. (WSR-88D) After that, from the menu which you can access by clicking three vertical dots, you can then select "TDWR" as the "Station Type". To make things easier, the link we have is for a specific radar site, but it does show icons you can click for other TDWR radar sites.

The radar imagery on their weather page, and on the radar page here, is an interactive map from The Weather Company. Since a lot of TV stations have similar site formats, we also tried this page by guessing at it and it only had current temperatures. The only way we were able to view data from this radar was by downloading their weather app here. Rather than using the default "Precipitation (Radar)" option under "Weather Conditions", you have to select "First Alert Doppler 5" to view data. We last tried this in September 2021. There were no radar returns to view at the time, though it did appear to be working.

Note: We only draw ranges for NEXRAD and TDWR radars in the United States. Most of the other radars in the United States are from television stations. It is too difficult to determine what the range of publicly available imagery is for other radars. It is often difficult to even determine if the other radars have data available online. Many of the television station websites use interactive maps that contain data from across the United States. Their websites often do not seem to include data from their own radar. Even if they have other imagery, it is not always clear if it is from their own radar. It would also make the map too cluttered to draw even more ranges on the map for the United States.

When viewing the radar layer on their interactive map, you can view data from their radar when zoomed in. When you zoom out, it defaults to a national radar view from The Weather Company. For some of the NBC stations that are owned by NBCUniversal, there are multiple other local radars on the map. When you zoom in to them, you will then get local radar data. The top of the map will say if it is the "National Radar" or the name of the local radar you are viewing. The range we note comes from the code of the page. We do not draw the range on the map.

To select a TDWR site from the front page of NOAA's radar display, you have to first select a regular NEXRAD site. (WSR-88D) After that, from the menu which you can access by clicking three vertical dots, you can then select "TDWR" as the "Station Type". To make things easier, the link we have is for a specific radar site, but it does show icons you can click for other TDWR radar sites.

The following is a default message we include for many of the television station radars in the United States. For many of these radars, we are unable to determine if the radar is still in use. It's also difficult to determine if data from these radars is available online. Many of the TV stations have websites that have dynamic maps, usually from The Weather Company. These maps usually do not contain an overlay that contains radar data for the radar that the TV station may own. Sometimes the TV stations also have additional radar imagery, such as an image loop of their area. They might have multiple images with various close-up views in their viewing area. In these instances it's often very difficult to determine which TV stations have radar data from their own radar online. (unless we can determine from the imagery where the data seems to be originating from, either by the radar site being marked or through radar returns) For these stations we usually link to their website's main weather page. The main weather page may have multiple radar views, including an interactive radar map and possibly other radar imagery as well. Even though some of these sites have a dedicated radar page, often that radar page only has the interactive radar map and not the other radar imagery that could contain data from their radar. Just because we link to a site doesn't mean that the radar data from that radar is available online. It's too complex to try to determine definitively, without contacting various TV stations, if their radar data is available online. If we did additional research, we may also include that additional information before this paragraph. Some of these TV stations will use their radar data in their own coverage, either on television or through their social media. If we come across information that suggests that, we will provide it. But due to the number of stations, we don't do much research trying to determine if these radars are used in that way. We do not draw ranges on the map for these radars.

To view their radar data, click on the "Layers" icon in the bottom right corner on their interactive radar. Then click the layer "Local Radar" in the layers section. You can also view a live stream of their radar here.

There are two radars at this location. We picked the one with the larger dome for the coordinates we use. The other is about 45 meters to the south. Based on the FCC license here, when comparing to the other radar, the height of their tower is shorter than the other. By measuring shadows, we determined this is the shorter radar.

Note: We only draw ranges for NEXRAD and TDWR radars in the United States. Most of the other radars in the United States are from television stations. It is too difficult to determine what the range of publicly available imagery is for other radars. It is often difficult to even determine if the other radars have data available online. Many of the television station websites use interactive maps that contain data from across the United States. Their websites often do not seem to include data from their own radar. Even if they have other imagery, it is not always clear if it is from their own radar. It would also make the map too cluttered to draw even more ranges on the map for the United States.

The following is a default message we include for many of the television station radars in the United States. For many of these radars, we are unable to determine if the radar is still in use. It's also difficult to determine if data from these radars is available online. Many of the TV stations have websites that have dynamic maps, usually from The Weather Company. These maps usually do not contain an overlay that contains radar data for the radar that the TV station may own. Sometimes the TV stations also have additional radar imagery, such as an image loop of their area. They might have multiple images with various close-up views in their viewing area. In these instances it's often very difficult to determine which TV stations have radar data from their own radar online. (unless we can determine from the imagery where the data seems to be originating from, either by the radar site being marked or through radar returns) For these stations we usually link to their website's main weather page. The main weather page may have multiple radar views, including an interactive radar map and possibly other radar imagery as well. Even though some of these sites have a dedicated radar page, often that radar page only has the interactive radar map and not the other radar imagery that could contain data from their radar. Just because we link to a site doesn't mean that the radar data from that radar is available online. It's too complex to try to determine definitively, without contacting various TV stations, if their radar data is available online. If we did additional research, we may also include that additional information before this paragraph. Some of these TV stations will use their radar data in their own coverage, either on television or through their social media. If we come across information that suggests that, we will provide it. But due to the number of stations, we don't do much research trying to determine if these radars are used in that way. We do not draw ranges on the map for these radars.

We could not find any radar data from their radar on their site. While they have a section on "Maps and Radar for Active Storms", when looking at some of the past history at the Internet Archive, they had data from NOAA and not their radar.

There are two radars at this location. The other is about 45 meters to the north. Based on the FCC license here, when comparing to the other radar, the height of their tower is taller than the other. By measuring shadows, we determined this is the taller radar.

When viewing the radar layer on their interactive map, you can view data from their radar when zoomed in. When you zoom out, it defaults to a national radar view from The Weather Company. For some of the NBC stations that are owned by NBCUniversal, there are multiple other local radars on the map. When you zoom in to them, you will then get local radar data. The top of the map will say if it is the "National Radar" or the name of the local radar you are viewing. The range we note comes from the code of the page. We do not draw the range on the map.

Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR)
NOAA: RIDGE2 Display

To select a TDWR site from the front page of NOAA's radar display, you have to first select a regular NEXRAD site. (WSR-88D) After that, from the menu which you can access by clicking three vertical dots, you can then select "TDWR" as the "Station Type". To make things easier, the link we have is for a specific radar site, but it does show icons you can click for other TDWR radar sites.

Note: We only draw ranges for NEXRAD and TDWR radars in the United States. Most of the other radars in the United States are from television stations. It is too difficult to determine what the range of publicly available imagery is for other radars. It is often difficult to even determine if the other radars have data available online. Many of the television station websites use interactive maps that contain data from across the United States. Their websites often do not seem to include data from their own radar. Even if they have other imagery, it is not always clear if it is from their own radar. It would also make the map too cluttered to draw even more ranges on the map for the United States.

The following is a default message we include for many of the television station radars in the United States. For many of these radars, we are unable to determine if the radar is still in use. It's also difficult to determine if data from these radars is available online. Many of the TV stations have websites that have dynamic maps, usually from The Weather Company. These maps usually do not contain an overlay that contains radar data for the radar that the TV station may own. Sometimes the TV stations also have additional radar imagery, such as an image loop of their area. They might have multiple images with various close-up views in their viewing area. In these instances it's often very difficult to determine which TV stations have radar data from their own radar online. (unless we can determine from the imagery where the data seems to be originating from, either by the radar site being marked or through radar returns) For these stations we usually link to their website's main weather page. The main weather page may have multiple radar views, including an interactive radar map and possibly other radar imagery as well. Even though some of these sites have a dedicated radar page, often that radar page only has the interactive radar map and not the other radar imagery that could contain data from their radar. Just because we link to a site doesn't mean that the radar data from that radar is available online. It's too complex to try to determine definitively, without contacting various TV stations, if their radar data is available online. If we did additional research, we may also include that additional information before this paragraph. Some of these TV stations will use their radar data in their own coverage, either on television or through their social media. If we come across information that suggests that, we will provide it. But due to the number of stations, we don't do much research trying to determine if these radars are used in that way. We do not draw ranges on the map for these radars.

To make things easier, the link we have is for a specific radar site, but it does show icons you can click for other TDWR radar sites.

The following is a default message we include for many of the television station radars in the United States. For many of these radars, we are unable to determine if the radar is still in use. It's also difficult to determine if data from these radars is available online. Many of the TV stations have websites that have dynamic maps, usually from The Weather Company. These maps usually do not contain an overlay that contains radar data for the radar that the TV station may own. Sometimes the TV stations also have additional radar imagery, such as an image loop of their area. They might have multiple images with various close-up views in their viewing area. In these instances it's often very difficult to determine which TV stations have radar data from their own radar online. (unless we can determine from the imagery where the data seems to be originating from, either by the radar site being marked or through radar returns) For these stations we usually link to their website's main weather page. The main weather page may have multiple radar views, including an interactive radar map and possibly other radar imagery as well. Even though some of these sites have a dedicated radar page, often that radar page only has the interactive radar map and not the other radar imagery that could contain data from their radar. Just because we link to a site doesn't mean that the radar data from that radar is available online. It's too complex to try to determine definitively, without contacting various TV stations, if their radar data is available online. If we did additional research, we may also include that additional information before this paragraph. Some of these TV stations will use their radar data in their own coverage, either on television or through their social media. If we come across information that suggests that, we will provide it. But due to the number of stations, we don't do much research trying to determine if these radars are used in that way. We do not draw ranges on the map for these radars.

It is too difficult to determine what the range of publicly available imagery is for other radars. It is often difficult to even determine if the other radars have data available online. Many of the television station websites use interactive maps that contain data from across the United States. Their websites often do not seem to include data from their own radar. Even if they have other imagery, it is not always clear if it is from their own radar. It would also make the map too cluttered to draw even more ranges on the map for the United States.

At the end of 2022, this radar will be moved to Hammond, Louisiana. You can learn more here. A quote from that page: "The KLIX WSR-88D radar is moving! The KLIX radar is currently co-located with the National Weather Service (NWS) in Slidell, LA. At the end of 2022, the radar will be moving west to Hammond, LA. During the move, the radar will be down for approximately three months."

Based on PDF page 186 in the detailed document here, this radar is likely to be moved to around 30.5193374N 90.407554W. That location is at Hammond North Shore Regional Airport and is about 59.5km west-northwest of the existing radar site.

The WMO Radar Database says that this is WTTG's radar, a local Fox affiliate. As of 2020, Fox still had an active license from the FCC to operated this radar. This radar is on land at the Howard University Beltsville Campus. A "Curriculum Vitae" document downloaded from the page here says "Negotiated a Doppler Radar transfer from the local Fox affiliate to the Howard University North campus - valued at $2M.". An article here from February 2012, mentions the Beltsville Campus having a Doppler radar. A PDF file here says the radar is a C-band radar. For now, we continue to list this as WTTG's radar.

The following is a default message we include for many of the television station radars in the United States. For many of these radars, we are unable to determine if the radar is still in use. It's also difficult to determine if data from these radars is available online. Many of the TV stations have websites that have dynamic maps, usually from The Weather Company. These maps usually do not contain an overlay that contains radar data for the radar that the TV station may own. Sometimes the TV stations also have additional radar imagery, such as an image loop of their area. They might have multiple images with various close-up views in their viewing area. In these instances it's often very difficult to determine which TV stations have radar data from their own radar online. (unless we can determine from the imagery where the data seems to be originating from, either by the radar site being marked or through radar returns) For these stations we usually link to their website's main weather page. The main weather page may have multiple radar views, including an interactive radar map and possibly other radar imagery as well. Even though some of these sites have a dedicated radar page, often that radar page only has the interactive radar map and not the other radar imagery that could contain data from their radar. Just because we link to a site doesn't mean that the radar data from that radar is available online. It's too complex to try to determine definitively, without contacting various TV stations, if their radar data is available online. If we did additional research, we may also include that additional information before this paragraph. Some of these TV stations will use their radar data in their own coverage, either on television or through their social media. If we come across information that suggests that, we will provide it. But due to the number of stations, we don't do much research trying to determine if these radars are used in that way. We do not draw ranges on the map for these radars.

The location of this radar is a little uncertain. Based on coordinates from the FCC, and other information, this radar is on Provin Mountain. The only thing that looks like a radar is a small dome on top of what might be the older transmitter tower. That tower is what we use for coordinates. We viewed imagery from Microsoft Bing's "bird's eye" imagery for close-up imagery at this location. You can also view a picture here.

The following is a default message we include for many of the television station radars in the United States. For many of these radars, we are unable to determine if the radar is still in use. It's also difficult to determine if data from these radars is available online. Many of the TV stations have websites that have dynamic maps, usually from The Weather Company. These maps usually do not contain an overlay that contains radar data for the radar that the TV station may own. Sometimes the TV stations also have additional radar imagery, such as an image loop of their area. They might have multiple images with various close-up views in their viewing area. In these instances it's often very difficult to determine which TV stations have radar data from their own radar online. (unless we can determine from the imagery where the data seems to be originating from, either by the radar site being marked or through radar returns) For these stations we usually link to their website's main weather page. The main weather page may have multiple radar views, including an interactive radar map and possibly other radar imagery as well. Even though some of these sites have a dedicated radar page, often that radar page only has the interactive radar map and not the other radar imagery that could contain data from their radar. Just because we link to a site doesn't mean that the radar data from that radar is available online. It's too complex to try to determine definitively, without contacting various TV stations, if their radar data is available online. If we did additional research, we may also include that additional information before this paragraph. Some of these TV stations will use their radar data in their own coverage, either on television or through their social media. If we come across information that suggests that, we will provide it. But due to the number of stations, we don't do much research trying to determine if these radars are used in that way. We do not draw ranges on the map for these radars.

To select a TDWR site from the front page of NOAA's radar display, you have to first select a regular NEXRAD site. (WSR-88D) After that, from the menu which you can access by clicking three vertical dots, you can then select "TDWR" as the "Station Type". To make things easier, the link we have is for a specific radar site, but it does show icons you can click for other TDWR radar sites.

The location of the Fallon Supplemental Weather Radar (SWR) is uncertain. We chose a tower at the Naval Air Station that could be the radar based on being close to the center of the imagery. There is a picture here from 2004. A PDF here has imagery from 2005 for this radar site, so the radar existed at least since then and it's possible the tower we chose is the radar. There are other possibilities and the radar could be somewhere else nearby.

Some of these TV stations will use their radar data in their own coverage, either on television or through their social media. If we come across information that suggests that, we will provide it. But due to the number of stations, we don't do much research trying to determine if these radars are used in that way. We do not draw ranges on the map for these radars.

The following is a default message we include for many of the television station radars in the United States. For many of these radars, we are unable to determine if the radar is still in use. It's also difficult to determine if data from these radars is available online. Many of the TV stations have websites that have dynamic maps, usually from The Weather Company. These maps usually do not contain an overlay that contains radar data for the radar that the TV station may own. Sometimes the TV stations also have additional radar imagery, such as an image loop of their area. They might have multiple images with various close-up views in their viewing area. In these instances it's often very difficult to determine which TV stations have radar data from their own radar online. (unless we can determine from the imagery where the data seems to be originating from, either by the radar site being marked or through radar returns) For these stations we usually link to their website's main weather page. The main weather page may have multiple radar views, including an interactive radar map and possibly other radar imagery as well. Even though some of these sites have a dedicated radar page, often that radar page only has the interactive radar map and not the other radar imagery that could contain data from their radar. Just because we link to a site doesn't mean that the radar data from that radar is available online. It's too complex to try to determine definitively, without contacting various TV stations, if their radar data is available online.

Note: We only draw ranges for NEXRAD and TDWR radars in the United States. Most of the other radars in the United States are from television stations. It is too difficult to determine what the range of publicly available imagery is for other radars. It is often difficult to even determine if the other radars have data available online. Many of the television station websites use interactive maps that contain data from across the United States. Their websites often do not seem to include data from their own radar. Even if they have other imagery, it is not always clear if it is from their own radar. It would also make the map too cluttered to draw even more ranges on the map for the United States.

Their station moved from the location that the radar is at. The previous building was torn down in 2017 or 2018. As of April 2022, it was still there. However, the license expired in 2014 and we couldn't find an updated one when we looked in October 2022.

When we checked their radar page, we couldn't determine which radar, or radars, their imagery was coming from. A link below their radar imagery, "WATCH: DUALDoppler 5000 radar livestream", also contained radar data in a live video stream. While the animation includes a rotating line that usually makes it easy to see where the radar is coming from, the NWS radar is only about 3.5km away from the WRAL radar. It seemed that the line was rotating around where the NWS radar is. A message on that page said "Livestream from WRAL's DUALDoppler5000 and Fayetteville Doppler radars. Video switches every 15 seconds between Central and Eastern North Carolina, Wake County and Sandhills areas." A video here, from when their radar was upgraded, indicates they call their Doppler radar "DUALDoppler5000". It might be that their website may have both, or either one, at times.

To view their radar data, click on the "Layers" icon in the bottom right corner on their interactive radar. Then click the layer "Local Radar" in the layers section. When we checked this radar on February 7th, 2022, the radar data was old. Only the time is noted, not the date, so we weren't sure how old the data was at that time.

From a FCC license granted in 2012, and effective in 2015, and now extended to 2032, WCPO seems to have another radar on their transmission tower about two-thirds of the way up, which is something you can see in Microsoft bird's eye imagery. There is what seems to be an old tower, that might have had a radar, about 60 meters away, but it has no dome on it. About 10 meters from that there is a dome, but we don't know if that is a radar. We chose the object on the transmission tower because the height listed at the FCC is 277 meters.

The following is a default message we include for many of the television station radars in the United States. For many of these radars, we are unable to determine if the radar is still in use. It's also difficult to determine if data from these radars is available online. Many of the TV stations have websites that have dynamic maps, usually from The Weather Company. These maps usually do not contain an overlay that contains radar data for the radar that the TV station may own. Sometimes the TV stations also have additional radar imagery, such as an image loop of their area. They might have multiple images with various close-up views in their viewing area. In these instances it's often very difficult to determine which TV stations have radar data from their own radar online. (unless we can determine from the imagery where the data seems to be originating from, either by the radar site being marked or through radar returns) For these stations we usually link to their website's main weather page. The main weather page may have multiple radar views, including an interactive radar map and possibly other radar imagery as well. Even though some of these sites have a dedicated radar page, often that radar page only has the interactive radar map and not the other radar imagery that could contain data from their radar. Just because we link to a site doesn't mean that the radar data from that radar is available online. It's too complex to try to determine definitively, without contacting various TV stations, if their radar data is available online. If we did additional research, we may also include that additional information before this paragraph.

Note: We only draw ranges for NEXRAD and TDWR radars in the United States. Most of the other radars in the United States are from television stations. It is too difficult to determine what the range of publicly available imagery is for other radars. It is often difficult to even determine if the other radars have data available online. Many of the television station websites use interactive maps that contain data from across the United States. Their websites often do not seem to include data from their own radar. Even if they have other imagery, it is not always clear if it is from their own radar. It would also make the map too cluttered to draw even more ranges on the map for the United States.

This seems to be a redundant FAA radar located at NOAA's Radar Operations Center. I don't know if data is available from this radar. The period of record for this radar site at NOAA's National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) was for a single day in 2014. An active TDWR site is about 6 km NW of this radar site.

Sometimes the TV stations also have additional radar imagery, such as an image loop of their area. They might have multiple images with various close-up views in their viewing area. In these instances it's often very difficult to determine which TV stations have radar data from their own radar online. (unless we can determine from the imagery where the data seems to be originating from, either by the radar site being marked or through radar returns) For these stations we usually link to their website's main weather page. The main weather page may have multiple radar views, including an interactive radar map and possibly other radar imagery as well. Even though some of these sites have a dedicated radar page, often that radar page only has the interactive radar map and not the other radar imagery that could contain data from their radar. Just because we link to a site doesn't mean that the radar data from that radar is available online. It's too complex to try to determine definitively, without contacting various TV stations, if their radar data is available online. If we did additional research, we may also include that additional information before this paragraph. Some of these TV stations will use their radar data in their own coverage, either on television or through their social media. If we come across information that suggests that, we will provide it. But due to the number of stations, we don't do much research trying to determine if these radars are used in that way. We do not draw ranges on the map for these radars.

When viewing the radar layer on their interactive map, you can view data from their radar when zoomed in. When you zoom out, it defaults to a national radar view from The Weather Company. For some of the NBC stations that are owned by NBCUniversal, there are multiple other local radars on the map. When you zoom in to them, you will then get local radar data. The top of the map will say if it is the "National Radar" or the name of the local radar you are viewing. The range we note comes from the code of the page. We do not draw the range on the map.

Note: We only draw ranges for NEXRAD and TDWR radars in the United States. Most of the other radars in the United States are from television stations. It is too difficult to determine what the range of publicly available imagery is for other radars. It is often difficult to even determine if the other radars have data available online. Many of the television station websites use interactive maps that contain data from across the United States. Their websites often do not seem to include data from their own radar. Even if they have other imagery, it is not always clear if it is from their own radar. It would also make the map too cluttered to draw even more ranges on the map for the United States.

The location of this radar is uncertain. The coordinates we selected are about 2.1km from where the FCC license here has this radar at. There is a dome, which you can see here, on a tall building that is likely the radar. The FCC license says this radar is on a building and it seems that the building is about 56 meters tall. That matches well with this building.

While the interactive display might not have imagery from this Furuno X-band radar, the page does have a single image available below the interactive display that does. They have a YouTube channel that has a live stream from their weather channel that occasionally displays radar data from this site, as well as others in the region.

Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR)
NOAA: RIDGE2 Display

To select a TDWR site from the front page of NOAA's radar display, you have to first select a regular NEXRAD site. (WSR-88D) After that, from the menu which you can access by clicking three vertical dots, you can then select "TDWR" as the "Station Type". To make things easier, the link we have is for a specific radar site, but it does show icons you can click for other TDWR radar sites.

The following is a default message we include for many of the television station radars in the United States. For many of these radars, we are unable to determine if the radar is still in use. It's also difficult to determine if data from these radars is available online. Many of the TV stations have websites that have dynamic maps, usually from The Weather Company. These maps usually do not contain an overlay that contains radar data for the radar that the TV station may own. Sometimes the TV stations also have additional radar imagery, such as an image loop of their area. They might have multiple images with various close-up views in their viewing area. In these instances it's often very difficult to determine which TV stations have radar data from their own radar online. (unless we can determine from the imagery where the data seems to be originating from, either by the radar site being marked or through radar returns) For these stations we usually link to their website's main weather page. The main weather page may have multiple radar views, including an interactive radar map and possibly other radar imagery as well. Even though some of these sites have a dedicated radar page, often that radar page only has the interactive radar map and not the other radar imagery that could contain data from their radar. Just because we link to a site doesn't mean that the radar data from that radar is available online. It's too complex to try to determine definitively, without contacting various TV stations, if their radar data is available online. If we did additional research, we may also include that additional information before this paragraph. Some of these TV stations will use their radar data in their own coverage, either on television or through their social media. If we come across information that suggests that, we will provide it. But due to the number of stations, we don't do much research trying to determine if these radars are used in that way. We do not draw ranges on the map for these radars.

Some of these TV stations will use their radar data in their own coverage, either on television or through their social media. If we come across information that suggests that, we will provide it. But due to the number of stations, we don't do much research trying to determine if these radars are used in that way. We do not draw ranges on the map for these radars.

The following is a default message we include for many of the television station radars in the United States. For many of these radars, we are unable to determine if the radar is still in use. It's also difficult to determine if data from these radars is available online. Many of the TV stations have websites that have dynamic maps, usually from The Weather Company. These maps usually do not contain an overlay that contains radar data for the radar that the TV station may own. Sometimes the TV stations also have additional radar imagery, such as an image loop of their area. They might have multiple images with various close-up views in their viewing area. In these instances it's often very difficult to determine which TV stations have radar data from their own radar online. (unless we can determine from the imagery where the data seems to be originating from, either by the radar site being marked or through radar returns) For these stations we usually link to their website's main weather page. The main weather page may have multiple radar views, including an interactive radar map and possibly other radar imagery as well. Even though some of these sites have a dedicated radar page, often that radar page only has the interactive radar map and not the other radar imagery that could contain data from their radar. Just because we link to a site doesn't mean that the radar data from that radar is available online.

When viewing the radar layer on their interactive map, you can view data from their radar when zoomed in. When you zoom out, it defaults to a national radar view from The Weather Company. For some of the NBC stations that are owned by NBCUniversal, there are multiple other local radars on the map. When you zoom in to them, you will then get local radar data. The top of the map will say if it is the "National Radar" or the name of the local radar you are viewing. The range we note comes from the code of the page. We do not draw the range on the map.

Note: We only draw ranges for NEXRAD and TDWR radars in the United States. Most of the other radars in the United States are from television stations. It is too difficult to determine what the range of publicly available imagery is for other radars. It is often difficult to even determine if the other radars have data available online. Many of the television station websites use interactive maps that contain data from across the United States. Their websites often do not seem to include data from their own radar. Even if they have other imagery, it is not always clear if it is from their own radar. It would also make the map too cluttered to draw even more ranges on the map for the United States.

The following is a default message we include for many of the television station radars in the United States. For many of these radars, we are unable to determine if the radar is still in use. It's also difficult to determine if data from these radars is available online. Many of the TV stations have websites that have dynamic maps, usually from The Weather Company. These maps usually do not contain an overlay that contains radar data for the radar that the TV station may own. Sometimes the TV stations also have additional radar imagery, such as an image loop of their area. They might have multiple images with various close-up views in their viewing area. In these instances it's often very difficult to determine which TV stations have radar data from their own radar online. (unless we can determine from the imagery where the data seems to be originating from, either by the radar site being marked or through radar returns) For these stations we usually link to their website's main weather page. The main weather page may have multiple radar views, including an interactive radar map and possibly other radar imagery as well. Even though some of these sites have a dedicated radar page, often that radar page only has the interactive radar map and not the other radar imagery that could contain data from their radar. Just because we link to a site doesn't mean that the radar data from that radar is available online. It's too complex to try to determine definitively, without contacting various TV stations, if their radar data is available online. If we did additional research, we may also include that additional information before this paragraph. Some of these TV stations will use their radar data in their own coverage, either on television or through their social media. If we come across information that suggests that, we will provide it. But due to the number of stations, we don't do much research trying to determine if these radars are used in that way. We do not draw ranges on the map for these radars.

Bulawayo (Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo International Airport), Zimbabwe
Based on when this tower appeared, this is likely the new radar at this airport.

Zimbabwe is installing five new radars according to Baron Weather. You can learn more here. According to the article here, these radars "will be situated at the MSD headquarters in Harare, Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo International Airport in Bulawayo, Buffalo Range, Victoria Falls and Kariba airports". While we have found what appears to be the new radar at their headquarters and Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo International Airport, we have not yet found the radars at Buffalo Range Airport, Victoria Falls Airport and Kariba Airport. They might not have been constructed yet. Satellite imagery wasn't recent enough at these airports to find them when we checked.

As of October 2022, when we reviewed the radars in Zimbabwe, we are unsure what their official website is. Their older website, listed with the WMO, now redirects to an adult website. Their most recent website now has ads and doesn't seem to be their site any longer. (even though it is linked from their social media channels) Based on archived pages at the Internet Archive and a document from the WMO that mentions their Twitter account, their official pages on social media can be found here: Twitter | Facebook

We have not seen imagery from their new radars online.
